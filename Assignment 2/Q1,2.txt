Q1) To familiarize with the Lab Network Topology, Locating different interfaces, routers and
switches. Studying different pools of IP addresses.

Ans> I explored lab’s network setup and identified the routers, switches, and interfaces connected in the network. I also checked the IP addresses assigned to different devices and networks. I also got to know about types and ranges  of Private Ip Address Pool and Public Ip Address Pool.

Q2)To learn and observe the usage of different networking commands e.g. PING, TRACEROUTE.
Learning remote login using telnet session. Measuring typical average delays between
different locations of the network.

Ans> I started by using the PING command to check if a host was reachable and to measure the average round-trip time. Next, I used TRACEROUTE to trace the path packets took from my system to a remote server. This helped me understand the number of hops and identify any delays or bottlenecks in the network path. I also practiced remote login using the Telnet command in the terminal which connected me to a server. It helped me understand how Telnet opens a session to control a remote machine.

Q3)"Ping” is a tool used to determine if a server is responding and to estimate the round trip-
time of a message sent to that server. Use the ping command for the following URLs and
record the success or failure statistics along with the average round trip time.
a) google.com
b) facebook.com
c) bitmesra.ac.in
